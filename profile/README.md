### What is Koksmat?

Koksmat is an open source framework that enables you to create, deploy, and manage Zero Trust Microservices. It is based on the MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless) architecture, which offers flexibility, scalability, and performance for modern web applications. Koksmat is designed to be accessible and user-friendly for both developers and administrators, as well as citizen developers who want to build apps without coding.
Why use Koksmat?

### Koksmat offers several advantages over traditional app development methods on Microsoft 365, such as:

-	It allows you to use any front-end technology of your choice, such as React, Angular, Vue, or Blazor, to create rich and interactive user interfaces.
-	It provides a set of reusable and configurable microservices that handle common app functionalities, such as authentication, authorization, data storage, notifications, workflows, and analytics.
-	It exposes a consistent and secure API layer that connects your app to Microsoft 365 services, such as SharePoint, Teams, Graph, Power Platform, and Azure.
-	It supports a cloud-native approach that enables you to deploy and scale your app on any cloud platform, such as Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud.
-	It simplifies the app lifecycle management by providing tools and best practices for testing, debugging, monitoring, and updating your app.
